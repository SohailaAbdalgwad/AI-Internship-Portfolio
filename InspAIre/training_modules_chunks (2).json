This book is\ncompletely different from other books about time management; although\nthere are thousands of books on the topic, almost all of them contain very\nsimilar techniques and methods, such as to-do lists, prioritization, strategic\nplanning, and so on. These are good and well-known traditional tools that\nhaven’t changed for half a century. But for the last ten years, technological\nprogress has significantly changed time management by creating new\nmethods and tools for managing time that were not widely available before.\nIn this book, you will not read about the traditional techniques of time",

What does this mean for those who seek to invest their\ntime wisely and value every second? It means that time has become more\nvaluable because the opportunities for investing in time have substantially\nincreased and become more effective.

I spent every day commuting\nto my university for more than two hours. During that time, I listened to\nmusic, not even realizing that there were such things as audio books. I was\nfrustrated that I spent so much time commuting and intuitively felt like\nsomething was wrong. I started to blame my circumstances; I thought that I\nlived too far from the university. I began to hate the time when I was in\ntransport; I just did not know what to do.

But you build\ndiscipline by preparing for fast spurts. –Charles Munger\nIf we write down all the tasks that we do every day, we may notice that\nthere are some tasks that are repeated day after day. There are also everyday\nroutines that don’t get reflected in our list of tasks. \nAlmost every person has a type of daily schedule characterized by morning\nand evening routines. People have a tendency to do a particular set of\nactivities at the same time every day. For instance, one person may be used\nto watching TV in the evening, while another person reads a book during\nthis time. Such tendencies can be referred to as habits, but this is not quite",
